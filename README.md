# Unseen Aid

**A wearable device that provides object detection and obstacle avoidance for visually impaired individuals**

## Description
Unseen Aid is a cost-effective wearable device designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings safely. The device utilizes object detection and obstacle avoidance technology to provide real-time feedback to the user, helping them detect obstacles and navigate through environments with greater ease and confidence.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Unseen Aid uses advanced object detection algorithms to identify obstacles and objects in the user's path.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The device provides auditory or tactile feedback to alert the user about obstacles in their vicinity, enabling them to navigate around them effectively.
- **Cost-Effective**: Our goal is to create an affordable solution that can be accessible to a wide range of users.
- **Wearable Design**: Unseen Aid is designed to be lightweight and comfortable for long-term wear, ensuring convenience and usability for the user.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The device offers real-time feedback, allowing users to react promptly to changes in their environment.

## How it Works
Unseen Aid utilizes a camera and the YOLOv3 algorithm to detect objects and obstacles in the user's surroundings. The captured data is processed using machine learning algorithms to identify and classify objects. When an obstacle is detected, the device provides feedback to the user through auditory cues, alerting them to the presence of obstacles and enabling them to navigate safely.

## Installation 
This project requires python==3.9. Install python3.9 from python official page or follow the link - <href a> https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3919/ </a>.
After installing python check the version of python to verify download.

```
python --version
```

After verifying python version, create a virtual environment by following these steps.

```
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv venv
```

Activate virtual environment and install all the dependencies.

```
.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Update the code with your personal ip configuration and upload the code on ESPCam board. 
Run the blindPeople_v3 file to start the app.
